I am a Masters in Financial Analysis candidate, Merit Scholar, and Student Ambassador at London Business School. In May 2021, I finished my undergraduate studies at Bowdoin College and graduated cum laude and a year ahead of my starting class with an Economics major and a Mathematics minor. I recently completed an Investment Banking Summer Internship at Credicorp Capital, a leading Latin American investment bank.

Apart from being a sucker for academics and finance, I enjoy looking into music theory, watching football matches, and surfing. I have also recently developed an affinity for scuba diving.
