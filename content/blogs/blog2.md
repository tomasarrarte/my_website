Music... Where do I even begin? I listen to music for at least 2 hours a day and consider it to be one of the most fascinating things that life has to offer.

I like to listen to and play songs ranging across several genres, including classic rock, jazz, Latin, and progressive. Some of the artists and bands that I most enjoy are The Beatles, The Strokes, The Greatful Dead, Steely Dan, Charly Garcia, Oasis, and Bob Marley. 

But nothing really comes close to Led Zeppelin. In my opinion, they are at another level. Just listen to The Song Remains The Same followed by The Rain Song. I can guarantee that such experience will take your breath away.
